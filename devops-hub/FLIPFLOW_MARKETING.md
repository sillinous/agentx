Title: I built FlipFlow to help you avoid bad Flippa deals

Hey r/Entrepreneur,

After getting burned on a Flippa purchase myself ($8K for a "profitable" site that made $0), I built FlipFlow - an AI tool that analyzes online business listings in 30 seconds.

It checks:
• Revenue verification (cross-references claims with data patterns)
• Traffic analysis (trends, sources, quality)
• Valuation accuracy (is the asking price justified?)
• Red flags (seller history, suspicious patterns, etc.)

I'm offering 3 free analyses to test it out: flipflow.com

Would love your feedback! What do YOU look for when evaluating a business to buy?

**Post 2: Ask Me Anything**

Title: I analyzed 500+ Flippa listings with AI. Here's what I learned. [AMA]

I spent 6 months building FlipFlow, an AI tool for analyzing online businesses on Flippa.

After processing 500+ listings, here are the biggest red flags:

• 43% of listings overstate revenue by 2x or more
• 67% have declining traffic trends (not disclosed)
• 89% of "passive income" claims require 10+ hours/week

I'm offering free analyses to r/Entrepreneur members: flipflow.com
